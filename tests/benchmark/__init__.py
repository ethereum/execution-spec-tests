Benchmark tests for EVMs.

Benchmark tests aim to maximize the usage of a specific opcode, precompile,
or operation within a transaction or block. These can be executed against
EVM implementations to ensure they handle pathological cases efficiently
and correctly, allowing Ethereum to safely
[Scale the L1](https://protocol.ethereum.foundation/).
