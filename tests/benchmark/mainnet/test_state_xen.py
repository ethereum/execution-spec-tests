abstract: Tests practical scenarios on Mainnet with the XEN (which has a big state) contract

Tests practical scenarios on Mainnet with the XEN (which has a big state) contract.
This currently has one situation, but will be expanded with other scenarios.
The goal is to bloat as much of the big state of XEN as possible. XEN has a big state trie.
We therefore want to do as much state situations (either read or write: likely write is
the most expensive situation).
NOTE: this is thus NOT the worst-case scenario, since we can remove the overhead execution
computations for XEN and only do state operations on an account with a big state attached to it.
This therefore only tests the practical, "real life" and most likely scenario.
However, with enough funds (to bloat a contract state), this is thus not the worst scenario.
