| `test_bal_7702_delegation_create` | Ensure BAL captures creation of EOA delegation | Alice authorizes delegation to contract `Oracle`. Transaction sends 10 wei to Bob.

(2) Sponsored: `Relayer` sends both 7702 txs on Alice's behalf. | BAL **MUST** include Alice: first tx has `code_changes` (delegation designation `0xef0100\|\|address(Oracle)`), `nonce_changes`. Second tx has `code_changes` (empty code - delegation cleared), `nonce_changes`. Bob: `balance_changes` (receives 10 wei on each tx).

| `test_bal_7702_invalid_nonce_authorization` | Ensure BAL handles failed authorization due to wrong nonce | `Relayer` sends sponsored transaction to Bob (10 wei transfer succeeds) but Alice's authorization to delegate to `Oracle` uses incorrect nonce, causing silent authorization failure | BAL **MUST** include Alice with empty changes (account access), Bob with `balance_changes` (receives 10 wei), Relayer with `nonce_changes`. **MUST NOT** include `Oracle` (authorization failed, no delegation) | ✅ Completed |
| `test_bal_7702_invalid_chain_id_authorization` | Ensure BAL handles failed authorization due to wrong chain id | `Relayer` sends sponsored transaction to Bob (10 wei transfer succeeds) but Alice's authorization to delegate to `Oracle` uses incorrect chain id, causing authorization failure before account access | BAL **MUST** include Bob with `balance_changes` (receives 10 wei), Relayer with `nonce_changes`. **MUST NOT** include Alice (authorization fails before loading account) or `Oracle` (authorization failed, no delegation) | ✅ Completed |
| `test_bal_7702_delegated_via_call_opcode` | Ensure BAL captures delegation target when a contract uses *CALL opcodes to call a delegated account | Pre-deployed contract `Alice` delegated to `Oracle`. `Caller` contract uses CALL/CALLCODE/DELEGATECALL/STATICCALL to call `Alice`. Bob sends transaction to `Caller`. | BAL **MUST** include Bob: `nonce_changes`. `Caller`: empty changes (account access). `Alice`: empty changes (account access - delegated account being called). `Oracle`: empty changes (delegation target access). | ✅ Completed |
