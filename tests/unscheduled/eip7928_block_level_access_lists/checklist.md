# EIP-7928 Block Access Lists (BAL) Test Checklist

| Function Name | Goal | Setup | Expectation | Status |
|---------------|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| `test_bal_nonce_changes` | Ensure BAL captures changes to nonce | Alice sends 100 wei to Bob | BAL MUST include changes to Alice's nonce. | ‚úÖ Completed |
| `test_bal_balance_changes` | Ensure BAL captures changes to balance | Alice sends 100 wei to Bob | BAL MUST include balance change for Alice, Bob, and Coinbase | ‚úÖ Completed |
| `test_bal_storage_writes` | Ensure BAL captures storage writes | Alice calls contract that writes to storage slot `0x01` | BAL MUST include storage changes with correct slot and value | ‚úÖ Completed |
| `test_bal_storage_reads` | Ensure BAL captures storage reads | Alice calls contract that reads from storage slot `0x01` | BAL MUST include storage access for the read operation | ‚úÖ Completed |
| `test_bal_code_changes` | Ensure BAL captures changes to account code | Alice deploys factory contract that creates new contract | BAL MUST include code changes for newly deployed contract | ‚úÖ Completed |
| `test_bal_2930_slot_listed_but_untouched` | Ensure 2930 access list alone doesn‚Äôt appear in BAL        | Include `(KV, S=0x01)` in tx‚Äôs EIP-2930 access list; tx executes code that does **no** `SLOAD`/`SSTORE` to `S` (e.g., pure arithmetic/log). | BAL **MUST NOT** contain any entry for `(KV, S)` ‚Äî neither reads nor writes ‚Äî because the slot wasn‚Äôt touched.                                                                                                    | üü° Planned |
| `test_bal_2930_slot_listed_and_modified`  | Ensure BAL records writes only because the slot is touched | Same access list as above, but tx executes `SSTORE` to `S`.                                                                                 | BAL **MUST** include `storage_changes` for `(KV, S)` (and no separate read record for that slot if implementation deduplicates). Presence in the access list is irrelevant; inclusion is due to the actual write. | üü° Planned |
| `test_bal_7702_delegated_create`                 | BAL tracks EIP-7702 delegation indicator write and contract creation        | Alice sends a type-4 (7702) tx authorizing herself to delegate to `Deployer` code which executes `CREATE`                      | BAL MUST include for **Alice**: `code_changes` (delegation indicator), `nonce_changes` (increment from 7702 processing), and `balance_changes` (post-gas). For **Child**: `code_changes` (runtime bytecode) and `nonce_changes = 1`. | üü° Planned  |
| `test_bal_self_transfer`                         | BAL handles self-transfers correctly                                        | Alice sends `1 ETH` to **Alice**                                                                                               | BAL MUST include **one** entry for Alice with `balance_changes` reflecting **gas only** (value cancels out) and a nonce change; Coinbase balance updated for fees; no separate recipient row.                                        | üü° Planned  |
| `test_bal_system_contracts_2935_4788`            | BAL includes pre-exec system writes for parent hash & beacon root           | Build a block with `N` normal txs; 2935 & 4788 active                                                                          | BAL MUST include `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` (EIP-2935) and `BEACON_ROOTS_ADDRESS` (EIP-4788) with `storage_changes` to ring-buffer slots; each write uses `tx_index = N` (system op).                                                 | üü° Planned  |
| `test_bal_system_dequeue_withdrawals_eip7002`    | BAL tracks post-exec system dequeues for withdrawals                        | Pre-populate EIP-7002 withdrawal requests; produce a block where dequeues occur                                                | BAL MUST include the 7002 system contract with `storage_changes` (queue head/tail slots 0‚Äì3) using `tx_index = len(txs)` and balance changes for withdrawal recipients.                                                              | üü° Planned  |
| `test_bal_system_dequeue_consolidations_eip7251` | BAL tracks post-exec system dequeues for consolidations                     | Pre-populate EIP-7251 consolidation requests; produce a block where dequeues occur                                             | BAL MUST include the 7251 system contract with `storage_changes` (queue slots 0‚Äì3) using `tx_index = len(txs)`.                                                                                                                      | üü° Planned  |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Scope describes whether a test spans a single transaction (`tx`) or entire block (`blk`).
