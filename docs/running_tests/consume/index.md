# The `consume` Command

The EEST `consume` command implements different methods to run EEST-generated test fixtures against clients:

```bash
uv run consume [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND [ARGS]...
```

For help with installation, see [Installation](../../getting_started/installation.md).

This section provides help for running the EEST commands directly (against a [`./hive --dev` backend](../hive/dev_mode.md), where applicable), see:

1. [Consume Cache & Fixture Inputs](./cache.md) for how to specifying `consume` fixture input.

2. [Consume Direct](./direct.md) to run test fixtures against direct client interfaces.

3. [Consume Simulators](./simulators.md) for help with Hive Simulators.
