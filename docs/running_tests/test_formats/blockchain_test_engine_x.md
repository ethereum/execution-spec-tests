# Blockchain Engine X Tests  <!-- markdownlint-disable MD051 (MD051=link-fragments "Link fragments should be valid") -->

The Blockchain Engine X Test fixture format tests are included in the fixtures subdirectory `blockchain_tests_engine_x`, and use Engine API directives with optimized pre-allocation groups for improved execution performance.

These are produced by the `StateTest` and `BlockchainTest` test specs when using the `--generate-pre-alloc-groups` and `--use-pre-alloc-groups` flags.

## Description

The Blockchain Engine X Test fixture format is an optimized variant of the [Blockchain Engine Test](./blockchain_test_engine.md) format designed for large-scale test execution with performance optimizations.

It uses the Engine API to test block validation and consensus rules while leveraging **pre-allocation groups** to significantly reduce test execution time and resource usage. Tests are grouped by their initial state (fork + environment + pre-allocation). Each group is executed against the same client instance using a common genesis state.

The key optimization is that **clients need only be started once per group** instead of once per test (as in the original engine fixture format), dramatically improving execution performance for large test suites.

Instead of including large pre-allocation state in each test fixture, this format references a pre-allocation groups folder (`pre_alloc`) which contains all different pre-allocation combinations organized by group.

A single JSON fixture file is composed of a JSON object where each key-value pair is a different [`BlockchainTestEngineXFixture`](#BlockchainTestEngineXFixture) test object, with the key string representing the test name.

The JSON file path plus the test name are used as the unique test identifier.

## Pre-Allocation Groups Folder

The `blockchain_tests_engine_x` directory contains a special directory `pre_alloc` that stores pre-allocation group files used by all tests in this format, one per pre-allocation group with the name of the pre-alloc hash. This folder is essential for test execution and must be present alongside the test fixtures.

### Pre-Allocation Group File Structure

Each file in the `pre_alloc` folder corresponds to a pre-allocation group identified by a hash:

```json
{
   "test_count": 88,
   "pre_account_count": 174,
   "testIds": ["test1", "test2", ...],
   "network": "Prague",
   "environment": { ... },
   "pre": { ... }
}
```

#### Pre-Allocation Group Fields

- **`test_count`**: Number of tests in this pre-allocation group
- **`pre_account_count`**: Number of accounts in the pre-allocation group
- **`testIds`**: Array of test identifiers that belong to this group
- **`network`**: Fork name (e.g., "Prague", "Cancun")
- **`environment`**: Complete [`Environment`](./common_types.md#environment) object with execution context
- **`pre`**: Pre-allocation group [`Alloc`](./common_types.md#alloc-mappingaddressaccount) object containing initial account states

## Consumption

For each [`BlockchainTestEngineXFixture`](#BlockchainTestEngineXFixture) test object in the JSON fixture file, perform the following steps:

1. **Load Pre-Allocation Group**:
   - Read the appropriate file from the `pre_alloc` folder in the same directory
   - Locate the pre-allocation group using [`preHash`](#-prehash-string)
   - Extract the `pre` allocation and `environment` from the group

2. **Initialize Client**:
   - Use [`network`](#-network-fork) to configure the execution fork schedule
   - Use the pre-allocation group's `pre` allocation as the starting state
   - Use the pre-allocation group's `environment` as the execution context
   - Use [`genesisBlockHeader`](#-genesisblockheader-fixtureheader) as the genesis block header

3. **Execute Engine API Sequence**:
   - For each [`FixtureEngineNewPayload`](#fixtureenginenewpayload) in [`engineNewPayloads`](#-enginenewpayloads-listfixtureenginenewpayload):
     1. Deliver the payload using `engine_newPayloadVX`
     2. Validate the response according to the payload's expected status
   - If [`syncPayload`](#-syncpayload-optionalfixtureenginenewpayload) is present, execute it for chain synchronization

4. **Verify Final State**:
   - Compare the final chain head against [`lastblockhash`](#-lastblockhash-hash)
   - If [`postStateDiff`](#-poststatediff-optionalalloc) is present:
     - Apply the state differences to the pre-allocation group
     - Verify the resulting state matches the client's final state
   - If `post` field were present (not typical), verify it directly

## Structures

### `BlockchainTestEngineXFixture`

#### - `network`: [`Fork`](./common_types.md#fork)

##### TO BE DEPRECATED

Fork configuration for the test.

This field is going to be replaced by the value contained in `config.network`.

#### - `preHash`: `string`

Hash identifier referencing a pre-allocation group in the `pre_alloc` folder. This hash uniquely identifies the combination of fork, environment, and pre-allocation state that defines the group.

#### - `genesisBlockHeader`: [`FixtureHeader`](./blockchain_test.md#fixtureheader)

Genesis block header. The state root in this header must match the state root calculated from the pre-allocation group referenced by [`preHash`](#-prehash-string).

#### - `engineNewPayloads`: [`List`](./common_types.md#list)`[`[`FixtureEngineNewPayload`](#fixtureenginenewpayload)`]`

List of `engine_newPayloadVX` directives to be processed after the genesis block. These define the sequence of blocks to be executed via the Engine API.

#### - `syncPayload`: [`Optional`](./common_types.md#optional)`[`[`FixtureEngineNewPayload`](#fixtureenginenewpayload)`]`

Optional synchronization payload. When present, this payload is typically used to sync the chain to a specific state before or after the main payload sequence.

#### - `lastblockhash`: [`Hash`](./common_types.md#hash)

Hash of the last valid block after all payloads have been processed, or the genesis block hash if all payloads are invalid.

#### - `postStateDiff`: [`Optional`](./common_types.md#optional)`[`[`Alloc`](./common_types.md#alloc-mappingaddressaccount)`]`

State differences from the pre-allocation group after test execution. This optimization stores only the accounts that changed, were created, or were deleted during test execution, rather than the complete final state.

To reconstruct the final state:

1. Start with the pre-allocation group from the `pre_alloc` folder
2. Apply the changes in `postStateDiff`:
   - **Modified accounts**: Replace existing accounts with new values
   - **New accounts**: Add accounts not present in pre-allocation  
   - **Deleted accounts**: Remove accounts (represented as `null` values)

#### - `config`: [`FixtureConfig`](#fixtureconfig)

Chain configuration object to be applied to the client running the blockchain engine x test.

### `FixtureConfig`

#### - `network`: [`Fork`](./common_types.md#fork)

Fork configuration for the test. It is guaranteed that this field contains the same value as the root field `network`.

#### - `blobSchedule`: [`BlobSchedule`](./common_types.md#blobschedule-mappingforkforkblobschedule)

Optional; present from Cancun on. Maps forks to their blob schedule configurations as defined by [EIP-7840](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840).

### `FixtureEngineNewPayload`

Engine API payload structure identical to the one defined in [Blockchain Engine Tests](./blockchain_test_engine.md#fixtureenginenewpayload). Includes execution payload, versioned hashes, parent beacon block root, validation errors, version, and error codes.

## Usage Notes

- This format is only generated when using `--generate-pre-alloc-groups` and `--use-pre-alloc-groups` flags
- The `pre_alloc` folder is essential and must be distributed with the test fixtures
- Tests are grouped by identical (fork + environment + pre-allocation) combinations
- The format is optimized for Engine API testing (post-Paris forks)
