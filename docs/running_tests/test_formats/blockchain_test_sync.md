# Blockchain Engine Sync Tests  <!-- markdownlint-disable MD051 (MD051=link-fragments "Link fragments should be valid") -->

The Blockchain Engine Sync Test fixture format tests are included in the fixtures subdirectory `blockchain_tests_sync`, and use Engine API directives to test client synchronization capabilities after fixtures are executed with valid payloads.

These are produced by the `BlockchainTest` test spec when `pytest.mark.verify_sync` is used as a test marker.

## Description

The Blockchain Engine Sync Test fixture format is used to test execution client synchronization between peers. It validates that clients can correctly sync state and blocks from another client using the Engine API and P2P networking.

The test works by:

1. Setting up a client under test, defining a pre-execution state, a series of `engine_newPayloadVX` directives, and a post-execution state, as in Blockchain Engine Test fixture formats.
2. Starting a sync client with the same genesis and pre-execution state.
3. Having the sync client synchronize from the client under test.
4. Verifying that both clients reach the same final state.

A single JSON fixture file is composed of a JSON object where each key-value pair is a different [`SyncFixture`](#syncfixture) test object, with the key string representing the test name.

The JSON file path plus the test name are used as the unique test identifier, as well as a `{client under test}::sync_{sync client}` identifier.

## Consumption

For each [`HiveFixture`](#hivefixture) test object in the JSON fixture file, perform the following steps:

### Client Under Test Setup

1. Start the client under test using:
    - [`network`](#-network-fork) to configure the execution fork schedule according to the [`Fork`](./common_types.md#fork) type definition.
    - [`pre`](#-pre-alloc) as the starting state allocation of the execution environment for the test and calculate the genesis state root.
    - [`genesisBlockHeader`](#-genesisblockheader-fixtureheader) as the genesis block header.

2. Verify the head of the chain is the genesis block, and the state root matches the one calculated on step 1, otherwise fail the test.

3. Process all [`FixtureEngineNewPayload`](#fixtureenginenewpayload) objects in [`engineNewPayloads`](#-enginenewpayloads-listfixtureenginenewpayload) to build the complete chain on the client under test.

### Sync Client Setup and Synchronization

1. Start a sync client using the same genesis configuration:
    - Use the same [`network`](#-network-fork), [`pre`](#-pre-alloc), and [`genesisBlockHeader`](#-genesisblockheader-fixtureheader).

2. Establish P2P connection between the clients:
    - Get the enode URL from the client under test
    - Use `admin_addPeer` to connect the sync client to the client under test

3. Trigger synchronization on the sync client:
    - Send the [`syncPayload`](#-syncpayload-fixtureenginenewpayload) using `engine_newPayloadVX`
    - Send `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedVX` pointing to the last block hash

4. Monitor and verify synchronization:
    - Wait for the sync client to reach the [`lastblockhash`](#-lastblockhash-hash)
    - Verify the final state root matches between both clients
    - If [`post`](#-post-alloc) is provided, verify the final state matches

## Differences from Blockchain Engine Tests

While the Blockchain Sync Test format is similar to the Blockchain Engine Test format, there are key differences:

1. **`syncPayload` field**: Contains the final block used to trigger synchronization on the sync client.
2. **Multi-client testing**: Tests involve two clients (client under test and sync client) rather than a single client.
3. **P2P networking**: Tests require P2P connection establishment between clients.
4. **No invalid blocks**: Sync tests only work with valid chains as invalid blocks cannot be synced.
5. **`postStateHash` field**: Optional field for state verification when full post-state is not included.

## Fork Support

Blockchain Sync Tests are only supported for post-merge forks (Paris and later) as they rely on the Engine API for synchronization triggering.
