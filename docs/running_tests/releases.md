# EEST Fixture Releases

## Formats and Release Layout

@ethereum/execution-spec-tests releases contain JSON test fixtures in various formats. Note that transaction type tests are executed directly from Python source using the [`execute`](./execute/index.md) command.

| Format                                                               | Consumed by the client                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Location in `.tar.gz` release                                       |

## Release URLs and Tarballs

### Versioning Scheme

EEST framework and test sources and fixture releases are tagged use a semantic versioning scheme, `<optional:<pre_release_name@>>v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` as following:

- `<MAJOR>`: An existing fixture format has changed (potentially breaking change). Action must be taken by client teams to ensure smooth upgrade to the new format.
- `<MINOR>`: Additional coverage (new tests, or a new format) have been added to the release.
- `<PATCH>`: A bug-fix release; an error in the tests or framework has been patched.

Please see below for an explanation of the optional `<pre_release_name>` that is used in pre-releases.

### Standard Releases

Releases are published on the @ethereum/execution-spec-tests [releases](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases) page. Standard releases are tagged using the format `vX.Y.Z` (they don't have a don't `<pre_release_name>`).

For standard releases, two tarballs are available:

| Release Artifact          | Fork/feature scope                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fixtures_stable.tar.gz`  | Tests for all forks up to and including the last deployed ("stable") mainnet fork ("must pass") |
| `fixtures_develop.tar.gz` | Tests for all forks up to and including the last development fork                               |

I.e., `fixtures_develop` are a superset of `fixtures_stable`.

### Pre-Release and Devnet Releases

Intermediate releases that target specific subsets of features or tests under active development are published at @ethereum/execution-spec-tests [releases](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases).

These releases are tagged using the format `<pre_release_name>@vX.Y.Z`.

Examples:

- [`fusaka-devnet-1@v1.0.0`](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/fusaka-devnet-1%40v1.0.0) - this fixture release contains tests adhering to the [Fusaka Devnet 1 spec](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/fusaka-devnet-1).
- [`zkevm@v1.0.0`](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/zkevm%40v0.1.0) - this fixture release contains tests specifically aimed at testing zkEVMs.

Devnet releases should be treated as WIP and may not yet contain full test coverage (or even coverage for all EIPs). The coverage provided by these releases is detailed in the corresponding release notes.

### Help Downloading Releases

The [`consume cache`](./consume/cache.md) command can be used to resolve EEST release and pre-release tags to release URLs and download them.
