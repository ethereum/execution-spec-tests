### üõ†Ô∏è Framework

- ‚ú® Adds two `consume` commands [#339](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/339):

   1. `consume direct` - Execute a test fixture directly against a client using a `blocktest`-like command (currently only geth supported).
   2. `consume rlp` - Execute a test fixture in a hive simulator against a client that imports the test's genesis config and blocks as RLP upon startup. This is a re-write of the [ethereum/consensus](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/tree/master/simulators/ethereum/consensus) Golang simulator.

- ‚ú® Add Prague to forks ([#419](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/419)).

- üêû Fix `fill -m yul_test` which failed to filter tests that are (dynamically) marked as a yul test ([#418](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/418)).
- üîÄ Helper methods `to_address`, `to_hash` and `to_hash_bytes` have been deprecated in favor of `Address` and `Hash`, which are automatically detected as opcode parameters and pushed to the stack in the resulting bytecode ([#422](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/422)).
- ‚ú® `Opcodes` enum now contains docstrings with each opcode description, including parameters and return values, which show up in many development environments ([#424](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/424)) @ThreeHrSleep.
- üîÄ Locally calculate state root for the genesis blocks in the blockchain tests instead of calling t8n ([#450](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/450)).
- üêû Fix bug that causes an exception during test collection because the fork parameter contains `None` ([#452](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/452)).
- ‚ú® The `_info` field in the test fixtures now contains a `hash` field, which is the hash of the test fixture, and a `hasher` script has been added which prints and performs calculations on top of the hashes of all fixtures (see `hasher -h`) ([#454](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/454)).
- ‚ú® Adds an optional `verify_sync` field to hive blockchain tests (EngineAPI). When set to true a second client attempts to sync to the first client that executed the tests ([#431](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/431)).
- üêû Fix manually setting the gas limit in the genesis test env for post genesis blocks in blockchain tests ([#472](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/472)).

## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/v2.1.0) - 2024-01-29: üêçüèñÔ∏è Cancun

Release [v2.1.0](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/v2.1.0) primarily fixes a small bug introduced within the previous release where transition forks are used within the new `StateTest` format. This was highlighted by @chfast within #405 (https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/issues/405), where the fork name `ShanghaiToCancunAtTime15k` was found within state tests.

### üß™ Test Cases

- ‚ú® [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844): Adds `test_blob_gas_subtraction_tx()` verifying the blob gas fee is subtracted from the sender before executing the blob tx ([#407](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/407)).

### üõ†Ô∏è Framework

- üêû State tests generated with transition forks no longer use the transition fork name in the fixture output, instead they use the actual enabled fork according to the state test's block number and timestamp ([#406](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/406)).

### üìã Misc

- ‚ú® Use `run-parallel` and shared wheel packages for `tox` ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/408)).

### üõ†Ô∏è Framework

- ‚ú® Add `StateTest` fixture format generation; `StateTests` now generate a `StateTest` and a corresponding `BlockchainTest` test fixture, previously only `BlockchainTest` fixtures were generated ([#368](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/368)).
- ‚ú® Add `StateTestOnly` fixture format is now available and its only difference with `StateTest` is that it does not produce a `BlockchainTest` ([#368](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/368)).
- ‚ú® Add `evm_bytes_to_python` command-line utility which converts EVM bytecode to Python Opcodes ([#357](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/357)).
- ‚ú® Fork objects used to write tests can now be compared using the `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` operators, to check for a fork being newer than, newer than or equal, older than, older than or equal, respectively when compared against other fork ([#367](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/367)).

- üîÄ Update fork name from "Merge" to "Paris" used within the framework and tests ([#363](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/363)).
- üí• Replace `=` with `_` in pytest node ids and test fixture names ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/342)).
- üí• The `StateTest`, spec format used to write tests, is now limited to a single transaction per test ([#361](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/361)).
- üí• Tests must now use `BlockException` and `TransactionException` to define the expected exception of a given test, which can be used to test whether the client is hitting the proper exception when processing the block or transaction ([#384](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/384)).
- üí• `fill`: Remove the `--enable-hive` flag; now all test types are generated by default ([#358](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/358)).
- üí• Rename test fixtures names to match the corresponding pytest node ID as generated using `fill` ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/342)).

### üìã Misc

- ‚ú® Docs: Add a ["Consuming Tests"](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/consuming_tests/) section to the docs, where each test fixture format is described, along with the steps to consume them, and the description of the structures used in each format ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/375)).
- üîÄ Docs: Update `t8n` tool branch to fill tests for development features in the [readme](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-test) ([#338](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/338)).

- üîÄ CLI: `evm_bytes_to_python` is renamed to `evm_bytes` and now accepts flag `--assembly` to output the code in assembly format ([#844](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/844))

### üí• Breaking Changes

A concrete example of the test name renaming and change in directory structure is provided below.

1. Fixture output, including release tarballs, now contain subdirectories for different test types:

   1. `blockchain_tests`: Contains `BlockchainTest` formatted tests
   2. `blockchain_tests_hive`: Contains `BlockchainTest` with Engine API call directives for use in hive
   3. `state_tests`: Contains `StateTest` formatted tests

2. `StateTest`, spec format used to write tests, is now limited to a single transaction per test.
3. In this release the pytest node ID is now used for fixture names (previously only the test parameters were used), this should not be breaking. However, `=` in both node IDs (and therefore fixture names) have been replaced with `_`, which may break tooling that depends on the `=` character.
4. Produced `blockchain_tests` fixtures and their corresponding `blockchain_tests_hive` fixtures now contain the named exceptions `BlockException` and `TransactionException` as strings in the `expectException` and `validationError` fields, respectively. These exceptions can be used to test whether the client is hitting the proper exception when processing an invalid block.

   Blockchain test:

   ```json
   "blocks": [
         {
            ...
            "expectException": "TransactionException.INSUFFICIENT_ACCOUNT_FUNDS",
            ...
         }
         ...
   ]
   ```

   Blockchain hive test:

   ```json
   "engineNewPayloads": [
         {
            ...
            "validationError": "TransactionException.INSUFFICIENT_ACCOUNT_FUNDS",
            ...
         }
         ...
   ]
   ```

#### Renaming and Release Tarball Directory Structure Change Example

The fixture renaming provides a more consistent naming scheme between the pytest node ID and fixture name and allows the fixture name to be provided directly to pytest 5on the command line to execute individual tests in isolation, e.g. `pytest tests/frontier/opcodes/test_dup.py::test_dup[fork_Frontier]`.

1. Pytest node ID example:

   1. Previous node ID: `tests/frontier/opcodes/test_dup.py::test_dup[fork=Frontier]`.
   2. New node ID: `tests/frontier/opcodes/test_dup.py::test_dup[fork_Frontier]`.

2. Fixture name example:

   1. Previous fixture name: `000-fork=Frontier`
   2. New fixture name: `tests/frontier/opcodes/test_dup.py::test_dup[fork_Frontier]` (now the same as the pytest node ID).

3. Fixture JSON file name example (within the release tarball):

   1. Previous fixture file name: `fixtures/frontier/opcodes/dup/dup.json` (`BlockChainTest` format).
   2. New fixture file names (all present within the release tarball):

     - `fixtures/state_tests/frontier/opcodes/dup/dup.json` (`StateTest` format).
     - `fixtures/blockchain_tests/frontier/opcodes/dup/dup.json` (`BlockChainTest` format).
     - `fixtures/blockchain_tests_hive/frontier/opcodes/dup/dup.json` (a blockchain test in `HiveFixture` format).
