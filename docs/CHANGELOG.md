# Changelog

Test fixtures for use by clients are available for each release on the [Github releases page](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases).

**Key:** ✨ = New, 🐞 = Fixed, 🔀 = Changed. 💥 = Breaking

## 🔜 [Unreleased]

### 💥 Breaking Changes

- Python 3.10 support was removed in this release ([#1808](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1808)).
- Tests for the Prague fork are now marked as stable will be included in the `fixtures_stable.tar.gz` tarball from now on.
- Tests for the Osaka fork are now included in the `fixtures_develop.tar.gz` tarball.

#### 💥 Important Change for EEST developers

- @ethereum/execution-spec-tests now requires `uv>=0.7.0` ([#1904](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1904)). If your version of `uv` is too old, please proceed as following.

   If `uv` was curl-installed (recommended), please run:

   ```bash
   uv self update
   ```

   If `uv` was pip-installed, then:

   ```bash
   pip uninstall uv
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

#### 💥 Important Change for test contributors

- EEST no longer allows usage of Yul code in Python tests. From now on, please make use of our opcode wrapper. Yul code is now only allowed in the "static tests" located in `./tests/static/` (these are test cases defined by JSON and YAML files instead of Python test functions that were originally maintained in [ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests)).
- In order to fill the static tests (which is not the case by default), please ensure that `solc` is located in your `PATH`.

#### 💥 Important Change for `fill` Users

The output behavior of `fill` has changed ([#1608](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1608)):

- Before: `fill` wrote fixtures into the directory specified by the `--output` flag (default: `fixtures`). This could have many unintended consequences, including unexpected errors if old or invalid fixtures existed in the directory (for details see [#1030](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/issues/1030)).
- Now: `fill` will exit without filling any tests if the specified directory exists and is not-empty. This may be overridden by adding the `--clean` flag, which will first remove the specified directory.

Additionally, writing debugging information to the EVM "dump directory" by default has been disabled. To obtain debug output, the `--evm-dump-dir` flag must now be explicitly set. As a consequence, the now redundant `--skip-evm-dump` option was removed ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1874)). This undoes functionality originally introduced in [#999](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/999) and [#1150](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1150).

#### Feature `zkevm` updated to `benchmark`

Due to the crossover between `zkevm` and `benchmark` tests, all instances of the former have been replaced with the latter nomenclature. Repository PR labels and titles are additionally updated to reflect this change.

This update renames the `zkevm` feature release to `benchmark_30M` and further expands the latter for 1M, 10M, 60M, 90M, and 120M block gas limits in `fixtures_benchmark_1M.tar.gz`, `fixtures_benchmark_10M.tar.gz`, `fixtures_benchmark_30M.tar.gz`, `fixtures_benchmark_60M.tar.gz`, `fixtures_benchmark_90M.tar.gz`, and `fixtures_benchmark_120M.tar.gz` respectively.

Users can select any of the artifacts depending on their testing needs for their provers.

### 🛠️ Framework

#### 🔀 Refactoring

- 🔀 Move `TransactionType` enum from test file to proper module location in `ethereum_test_types.transaction_types` for better code organization and reusability.
- ✨ Opcode classes now validate keyword arguments and raise `ValueError` with clear error messages.
- 🔀 This PR removes the `solc` requirement to fill Python test cases. Regular test contributors no longer need to concern themselves with `solc` and, as such, the `solc-select` dependency has been removed. The remaining tests that used Yul have been ported to the EEST opcode wrapper mini-lang and the use of Yul in Python tests is no longer supported. Maintainers only: To fill the "static" JSON and YAML tests (`./tests/static/`) locally, `solc` (ideally v0.8.24) must be available in your PATH.

#### `fill`

- ✨ Add the `ported_from` test marker to track Python test cases that were converted from static fillers in [ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) repository ([#1590](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1590)).
- ✨ Add a new pytest plugin, `ported_tests`, that lists the static fillers and PRs from `ported_from` markers for use in the coverage Github Workflow ([#1634](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1634)).
- ✨ Enable two-phase filling of fixtures with pre-allocation groups and add a `BlockchainEngineXFixture` format ([#1706](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1706), [#1760](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1760)).
- ✨ Add `--generate-all-formats` flag to enable generation of all fixture formats including `BlockchainEngineXFixture` in a single command; enable `--generate-all-formats` automatically for tarball output, `--output=fixtures.tar.gz`, [#1855](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1855).
- 🔀 Refactor: Encapsulate `fill`'s fixture output options (`--output`, `--flat-output`, `--single-fixture-per-file`) into a `FixtureOutput` class ([#1471](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1471),[#1612](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1612)).
- ✨ Don't warn about a "high Transaction gas_limit" for `zkevm` tests ([#1598](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1598)).
- 🐞 `fill` no longer writes generated fixtures into an existing, non-empty output directory; it must now be empty or `--clean` must be used to delete it first ([#1608](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1608)).
- 🐞 `zkevm` marked tests have been removed from `tests-deployed` tox environment into its own separate workflow `tests-deployed-zkevm` and are filled by `evmone-t8n` ([#1617](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1617)).
- ✨ Field `postStateHash` is now added to all `blockchain_test` and `blockchain_test_engine` tests that use `exclude_full_post_state_in_output` in place of `postState`. Fixes `evmone-blockchaintest` test consumption and indirectly fixes coverage runs for these tests ([#1667](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1667)).
- 🔀 Changed INVALID_DEPOSIT_EVENT_LAYOUT to a BlockException instead of a TransactionException ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1773)).
- 🔀 Disabled writing debugging information to the EVM "dump directory" to improve performance. To obtain debug output, the `--evm-dump-dir` flag must now be explicitly set. As a consequence, the now redundant `--skip-evm-dump` option was removed ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1874)).
- ✨ Generate unique addresses with Python for compatible static tests, instead of using hard-coded addresses from legacy static test fillers ([#1781](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1781)).

#### `consume`

- 🐞 Fix `consume cache --cache-folder` parameter being ignored, now properly caches fixtures in the specified directory instead of always using the default system cache location.
- 🔀 `consume` now automatically avoids GitHub API calls when using direct release URLs (better for CI environments), while release specifiers like `stable@latest` continue to use the API for version resolution ([#1788](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1788)).
- 🔀 Refactor consume simulator architecture to use explicit pytest plugin structure with forward-looking architecture ([#1801](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1801)).
- 🔀 Add exponential retry logic to initial fcu within consume engine ([#1815](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1815)).

#### `execute`

- ✨ Added new `Blob` class which can use the ckzg library to generate valid blobs at runtime ([#1614](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1614)).
- ✨ Added `blob_transaction_test` execute test spec, which allows tests that send blob transactions to a running client and verifying its `engine_getBlobsVX` endpoint behavior ([#1644](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1644)).
- ✨ Added `execute eth-config` command to test the `eth_config` RPC endpoint of a client, and includes configurations by default for Mainnet, Sepolia, Holesky, and Hoodi ([#1863](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1863)).

### 📋 Misc

- 🔀 Use only relative imports in `tests/` directory ([#1848](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1848)).
- 🔀 Convert absolute imports to relative imports in `src/` directory for better code maintainability ([#1907](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1907)).

## [v4.5.0](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/v4.5.0) - 2025-05-14

### 💥 Breaking Change

#### EOF removed from Osaka

Following ["Interop Testing Call 34"](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1499) and the procedural EIPs [PR](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9703) the decision to remove EOF from Osaka was made.

To accommodate EOF testing for the interim within EEST, its tests have migrated to a new `tests/unscheduled` folder. This folder will now contain tests for features that are not yet CFI'd in any fork. When EOF is CFI'd for a fork in the future, all tests will be moved from unscheduled to the respective future fork folder.

A new fork `EOFv1` has additionally been created to fill and consume EOF related fixtures. Client tests fillers such as `evmone` (and client consumers) will now need to use this fork name.

### 🛠️ Framework

- ✨ Add an empty account function for usage within fill and execute ([#1482](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1482)).
- ✨ Added `TransactionException.INTRINSIC_GAS_BELOW_FLOOR_GAS_COST` exception to specifically catch the case where the intrinsic gas cost is insufficient due to the data floor gas cost ([#1582](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1582)).

### 📋 Misc

- ✨ Engine API updates for Osaka, add `get_blobs` rpc method ([#1510](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1510)).
- ✨ The EIP Version checker has been moved from `fill` and `execute` to it's own command-line tool `check_eip_versions` that gets ran daily as a Github Action ([#1537](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1537)).
- 🔀 Add new `tests/unscheduled` folder, move EOF from Osaka to unscheduled, add `EOFv1` fork name for EOF tests ([#1507](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1507)).
- ✨ CI features now contain an optional field to skip them from EEST full releases, `benchmark` and EOF features are now feature only ([#1596](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1596)).
- 🐞 Don't attempt to install `solc` via `solc-select` on ARM (official Linux ARM builds of `solc` are not available at the time of writing, cf [ethereum/solidity#11351](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11351)) and add a version sanity check ([#1556](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1556)).

### 🧪 Test Cases

- 🔀 Automatically apply the `benchmark` marker to all tests under `./tests/benchmark/` and `./tests/prague/eip2537_bls_12_381_precompiles/` via conftest configuration ([#1534](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1534)).
- ✨ Port [calldataload](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/ae4791077e8fcf716136e70fe8392f1a1f1495fb/src/GeneralStateTestsFiller/VMTests/vmTests/calldatacopyFiller.yml) and [calldatasize](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/81862e4848585a438d64f911a19b3825f0f4cd95/src/GeneralStateTestsFiller/VMTests/vmTests/calldatasizeFiller.yml) tests ([#1236](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1236)).

## [v4.4.0](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/v4.4.0) - 2025-04-29

### 💥 Breaking Change

#### `fixtures_static`

A new fixture tarball has been included in this release: `fixtures_static.tar.gz`.

This tarball contains all tests inside of [`./tests/static`](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/tree/main/tests/static), which at this point only contains all tests copied from [`GeneralStateTests` in `ethereum/tests@7dc757ec132e372b6178a016b91f4c639f366c02`](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/7dc757ec132e372b6178a016b91f4c639f366c02/src/GeneralStateTestsFiller).

The tests have been filled using the new static test filler introduced in [#1336](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1336), and enhanced in [#1362](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1362) and [#1439](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1439).

Users can expect that all tests currently living in [ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/src) should eventually make its way into [`./tests/static`](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/tree/main/tests/static) and can rely that these tests, filled for new forks even, will be included in `fixtures_static.tar.gz`.

#### `fixtures_benchmark`

Another new fixture tarball has been included in this release: `fixtures_benchmark.tar.gz`.

Includes tests that are tailored specifically to test the execution layer proof generators.

### 🛠️ Framework

#### `fill`

- 🐞 Fix the reported fixture source URLs for the case of auto-generated tests ([#1488](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1488)).

#### `consume`

- 🐞 Fix the Hive commands used to reproduce test executions that are displayed in test descriptions in the Hive UI ([#1494](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1494)).
- 🐞 Fix consume direct fails for geth blockchain tests ([#1502](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1502)).

### 📋 Misc

### 🧪 Test Cases

- ✨ [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702): Test that DELEGATECALL to a 7702 target works as intended ([#1485](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1485)).
- ✨ [EIP-2573](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537): Includes a BLS12 point generator, alongside additional coverage many of the precompiles ([#1350](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1350)), ([#1505](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1505)).
- ✨ Add all [`GeneralStateTests` from `ethereum/tests`](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/7dc757ec132e372b6178a016b91f4c639f366c02/src/GeneralStateTestsFiller) to `execution-spec-tests` located now at [tests/static/state_tests](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/tree/main/tests/static/state_tests) ([#1442](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1442)).
- ✨ [EIP-2929](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929): Test that precompile addresses are cold/warm depending on the fork they are activated ([#1495](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1495)).

## [v4.3.0](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/v4.3.0) - 2025-04-18

### 💥 Breaking Change

#### Consume engine strict exception checking

`consume engine` now checks exceptions returned by the execution clients in their Engine API responses, specifically in the `validationError`field of the `engine_newPayloadVX` method.

While not strictly a breaking change since tests will continue to run normally, failures are expected if a client modifies their exception messages.

This feature can be disabled by using `--disable-strict-exception-matching` for specific clients or forks.

### 🛠️ Framework

#### `fill`

- ✨ The `static_filler` plug-in now has support for static state tests (from [GeneralStateTests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/src/GeneralStateTestsFiller)) ([#1362](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1362)).
- ✨ Introduce `pytest.mark.exception_test` to mark tests that contain an invalid transaction or block ([#1436](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1436)).
- 🐞 Fix `DeprecationWarning: Pickle, copy, and deepcopy support will be removed from itertools in Python 3.14.` by avoiding use `itertools` object in the spec `BaseTest` pydantic model ([#1414](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1414)).
- ✨ An optional configuration flag to override the maximum gas limit in the environment for filling or executing tests is now available. The `--block-gas-limit` flag overrides the default block gas limit during filling. The `--transaction-gas-limit` flag overrides the maximum for transactions during execution. ([#1470](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1470)).

#### `consume`

- 🐞 Fix fixture tarball downloading with regular, non-Github release URLS and with numerical versions in regular release specs, e.g., `stable@v4.2.0` ([#1437](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1437)).
- ✨ `consume engine` now has strict exception mapping enabled by default ([#1416](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1416)).

#### Tools

- 🔀 `generate_system_contract_deploy_test` test generator has been updated to handle system contracts that are not allowed to be absent when the fork happens ([#1394](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1394)).
- ✨ Add `generate_system_contract_error_test` to generate tests on system contracts that invalidate a block in case of error ([#1394](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1394)).

#### Exceptions

## [v4.2.0](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/v4.2.0) - 2025-04-08

**Note**: Although not a breaking change, `consume` users should delete the cache directory (typically located at `~/.cache/ethereum-execution-spec-tests`) used to store downloaded fixture release tarballs. This release adds support for [ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) and [ethereum/legacytests](https://github.com/ethereum/legacytests) fixture release downloads and the structure of the cache directory has been updated to accommodate this change.

To try this feature:

```shell
consume direct --input=https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/download/v17.0/fixtures_blockchain_tests.tgz
```

To determine the cache directory location, see the `--cache-folder` entry from the command:

```shell
consume cache --help
```

- Output folder for fixtures has been renamed from "blockchain_tests_hive" to "blockchain_tests_engine" ([#687](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/687)).

## [v2.1.1](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/v2.1.1) - 2024-03-09

### 🧪 Test Cases

- 🐞 Dynamic create2 collision from different transactions same block ([#430](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/430)).
- 🐞 Fix beacon root contract deployment tests so the account in the pre-alloc is not empty ([#425](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/425)).

### 🛠️ Framework

- ✨ Adds two `consume` commands [#339](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/339):

   1. `consume direct` - Execute a test fixture directly against a client using a `blocktest`-like command (currently only geth supported).
   2. `consume rlp` - Execute a test fixture in a hive simulator against a client that imports the test's genesis config and blocks as RLP upon startup. This is a re-write of the [ethereum/consensus](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/tree/master/simulators/ethereum/consensus) Golang simulator.

- ✨ Add Prague to forks ([#419](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/419)).

- 🐞 Fix `fill -m yul_test` which failed to filter tests that are (dynamically) marked as a yul test ([#418](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/418)).
- 🔀 Helper methods `to_address`, `to_hash` and `to_hash_bytes` have been deprecated in favor of `Address` and `Hash`, which are automatically detected as opcode parameters and pushed to the stack in the resulting bytecode ([#422](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/422)).
- ✨ `Opcodes` enum now contains docstrings with each opcode description, including parameters and return values, which show up in many development environments ([#424](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/424)) @ThreeHrSleep.
- 🔀 Locally calculate state root for the genesis blocks in the blockchain tests instead of calling t8n ([#450](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/450)).
- 🐞 Fix bug that causes an exception during test collection because the fork parameter contains `None` ([#452](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/452)).
- ✨ The `_info` field in the test fixtures now contains a `hash` field, which is the hash of the test fixture, and a `hasher` script has been added which prints and performs calculations on top of the hashes of all fixtures (see `hasher -h`) ([#454](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/454)).
- ✨ Adds an optional `verify_sync` field to hive blockchain tests (EngineAPI). When set to true a second client attempts to sync to the first client that executed the tests ([#431](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/431)).
- 🐞 Fix manually setting the gas limit in the genesis test env for post genesis blocks in blockchain tests ([#472](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/472)).

## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/v2.1.0) - 2024-01-29: 🐍🏖️ Cancun

Release [v2.1.0](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/v2.1.0) primarily fixes a small bug introduced within the previous release where transition forks are used within the new `StateTest` format. This was highlighted by @chfast within #405 (<https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/issues/405>), where the fork name `ShanghaiToCancunAtTime15k` was found within state tests.

### 🧪 Test Cases

- ✨ [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844): Adds `test_blob_gas_subtraction_tx()` verifying the blob gas fee is subtracted from the sender before executing the blob tx ([#407](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/407)).

### 🛠️ Framework

- 🐞 State tests generated with transition forks no longer use the transition fork name in the fixture output, instead they use the actual enabled fork according to the state test's block number and timestamp ([#406](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/406)).

### 📋 Misc

- ✨ Use `run-parallel` and shared wheel packages for `tox` ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/408)).

### 🛠️ Framework

- ✨ Add `StateTest` fixture format generation; `StateTests` now generate a `StateTest` and a corresponding `BlockchainTest` test fixture, previously only `BlockchainTest` fixtures were generated ([#368](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/368)).
- ✨ Add `StateTestOnly` fixture format is now available and its only difference with `StateTest` is that it does not produce a `BlockchainTest` ([#368](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/368)).
- ✨ Add `evm_bytes_to_python` command-line utility which converts EVM bytecode to Python Opcodes ([#357](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/357)).
- ✨ Fork objects used to write tests can now be compared using the `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` operators, to check for a fork being newer than, newer than or equal, older than, older than or equal, respectively when compared against other fork ([#367](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/367)).

- 🔀 Locally calculate the transactions list's root instead of using the one returned by t8n when producing BlockchainTests ([#353](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/353)).
- 🔀 Change custom exception classes to dataclasses to improve testability ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/386)).
- 🔀 Update fork name from "Merge" to "Paris" used within the framework and tests ([#363](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/363)).
- 💥 Replace `=` with `_` in pytest node ids and test fixture names ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/342)).
- 💥 The `StateTest`, spec format used to write tests, is now limited to a single transaction per test ([#361](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/361)).
- 💥 Tests must now use `BlockException` and `TransactionException` to define the expected exception of a given test, which can be used to test whether the client is hitting the proper exception when processing the block or transaction ([#384](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/384)).
- 💥 `fill`: Remove the `--enable-hive` flag; now all test types are generated by default ([#358](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/358)).
- 💥 Rename test fixtures names to match the corresponding pytest node ID as generated using `fill` ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/342)).

### 📋 Misc

- ✨ Docs: Add a ["Consuming Tests"](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/consuming_tests/) section to the docs, where each test fixture format is described, along with the steps to consume them, and the description of the structures used in each format ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/375)).
- 🔀 Docs: Update `t8n` tool branch to fill tests for development features in the [readme](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests) ([#338](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/338)).

### 💥 Breaking Changes

A concrete example of the test name renaming and change in directory structure is provided below.

1. Fixture output, including release tarballs, now contain subdirectories for different test types:

   1. `blockchain_tests`: Contains `BlockchainTest` formatted tests
   2. `blockchain_tests_hive`: Contains `BlockchainTest` with Engine API call directives for use in hive
   3. `state_tests`: Contains `StateTest` formatted tests

2. `StateTest`, spec format used to write tests, is now limited to a single transaction per test.
3. In this release the pytest node ID is now used for fixture names (previously only the test parameters were used), this should not be breaking. However, `=` in both node IDs (and therefore fixture names) have been replaced with `_`, which may break tooling that depends on the `=` character.
4. Produced `blockchain_tests` fixtures and their corresponding `blockchain_tests_hive` fixtures now contain the named exceptions `BlockException` and `TransactionException` as strings in the `expectException` and `validationError` fields, respectively. These exceptions can be used to test whether the client is hitting the proper exception when processing an invalid block.

   Blockchain test:

   ```json
   "blocks": [
         {
            ...
            "expectException": "TransactionException.INSUFFICIENT_ACCOUNT_FUNDS",
            ...
         }
         ...
   ]
   ```

   Blockchain hive test:

   ```json
   "engineNewPayloads": [
         {
            ...
            "validationError": "TransactionException.INSUFFICIENT_ACCOUNT_FUNDS",
            ...
         }
         ...
   ]
   ```

#### Renaming and Release Tarball Directory Structure Change Example

The fixture renaming provides a more consistent naming scheme between the pytest node ID and fixture name and allows the fixture name to be provided directly to pytest 5on the command line to execute individual tests in isolation, e.g. `pytest tests/frontier/opcodes/test_dup.py::test_dup[fork_Frontier]`.

1. Pytest node ID example:

   1. Previous node ID: `tests/frontier/opcodes/test_dup.py::test_dup[fork=Frontier]`.
   2. New node ID: `tests/frontier/opcodes/test_dup.py::test_dup[fork_Frontier]`.

2. Fixture name example:

   1. Previous fixture name: `000-fork=Frontier`
   2. New fixture name: `tests/frontier/opcodes/test_dup.py::test_dup[fork_Frontier]` (now the same as the pytest node ID).

3. Fixture JSON file name example (within the release tarball):

   1. Previous fixture file name: `fixtures/frontier/opcodes/dup/dup.json` (`BlockChainTest` format).
   2. New fixture file names (all present within the release tarball):

     - `fixtures/state_tests/frontier/opcodes/dup/dup.json` (`StateTest` format).
     - `fixtures/blockchain_tests/frontier/opcodes/dup/dup.json` (`BlockChainTest` format).
     - `fixtures/blockchain_tests_hive/frontier/opcodes/dup/dup.json` (a blockchain test in `HiveFixture` format).
