# Bad Opcode Test

The source code for this test is [here](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/tree/main/tests/vm/test_opcode_tests.py).
We will only go over the parts that are new.

We use [Python string templates](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings), so we need to import that library.

```python
from string import Template
```

In this test we need a couple of addresses, so we create them here.
Python lets us specify `<string>*<number>` when we need a string repeated multiple times, which makes for more readable code than `0x00...000C0DE`.

```python
    code_addr = "0x" + "0"*(40-4) + "C0DE"
    goat_addr = "0x" + "0"*(40-4) + "60A7"
```

We create `env` and `tx` first because they are constant.
This function will `yield` multiple tests, but always with the same `env` and `tx` values.

```python
    env = Environment()

    tx = Transaction(
           .
           .
           .
        )
```

Here we create two post states.
We will use whichever one is appropriate to the test we create.

```python
    post_valid = {
       code_addr: Account(
         storage={0x00: 1},
       ),
    }

    post_invalid = {
       code_addr: Account(
         storage={0x00: 0},
       ),
    }
```

Here we define a function (`opc_valid`) inside another function.
Python supports this, and it has two advantages:

- Avoid namespace pollution by restricting the function to where it is needed.
- Functions defined inside other functions can use the parameters and local variables of those functions.
  In this case, we need to use `fork`.

```python
    # Check if an Opcode is valid
    def opc_valid(opc):
        """
        Return whether opc will be evaluated as valid by the test or not.
        Note that some opcodes are evaluated as invalid because of the way they act
        """
```

This is the syntax for Python comments, `# <rest of the line>`.

```python
        # PUSH0 is only valid Shanghai and later
```

Opcode 0x5F (`PUSH0`) is only valid starting with the Shanghai fork.
We don't know what will be the fork names after Shanghai, so it is easiest to specify that prior to Shanghai it is invalid.
We don't need to worry about forks prior to London because the decorator for this test says it is only valid from London.

```python
        if fork in {"london", "paris"} and opc==0x5F:
```

Python has a [set data structure](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets).
We use this structure when the order of the values are irrelevant, and we just want to be able to check if something is a member or not.

Note that [`if` statements](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements) are also followed by a colon (`:`) and the code inside them indented.
That is the general Python syntax.

```python
            return False
```

Boolean values in Python are either `True` or `False`.

This test works by running an opcode and then does a [`SSTORE`](https://www.evm.codes/#55?fork=merge).
Opcodes that terminate execution, such as [`STOP`](https://www.evm.codes/#00?fork=merge) and [`RETURN`](https://www.evm.codes/#f3?fork=merge) also cause the `SSTORE` not to happen, so they must be treated as invalid.
The same is true for [`JUMP`](https://www.evm.codes/#56?fork=merge).

```python
        # Valid opcodes, but they are terminal, and so cause
        # the SSTORE not to happen
        if opc in {0x00, 0xF3, 0xFD, 0xFF}:
            return False


        # Jumps. If you jump to a random location, you skip the SSTORE
        if opc in {0x56}:
            return False
```

Next we return `True` for supported opcodes.

```python
        # Opcodes that aren't part of a range
        # 0x20 - SHA3
        # 0xFA - STATICCALL
        if opc in {0x20, 0xFA}:
            return True

```

In Python, as in math, you can use `a < b < c` for `a < b and b < c`.

```python
        # Arithmetic opcodes
        if 0x01 <= opc <= 0x0b:
            return True

        .
        .
        .
```

The last part the function returns `False`.
If we got here, then this is not a valid opcode.

```python
        return False
        # End of opc_valid
```

As this is the end of the function, the next code line is no longer indented (compared to the function definition code).

This is a [`for` loop](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements).
For loops iterate over a sequence, and the [`range`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#the-range-function) function, in this case, gives us the range 0..255.
As with functions and `if` statements, the `for` loop has a colon and includes the indented code.

```python
    # For every possible opcode
    for opc in range(256):
```

We have two post states.
One, `post_valid`, has the value of `1` in storage location `0`.
The other, `post_invalid` has the value of `0` in storage location `0`.
But `SELFDESTRUCT` destroys the contract so there is no longer an account at that address.
Neither is valid, so we just skip that test case.

```python
        # We can't check SELFDESTRUCT using this technique
        if opc in {0xFF}:
           continue
```

We need the opcode in hexadecimal.
The function [`hex`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hex) gives us the hexadecimal number in hex.
However, it also gives us a `0x` prefix, which we don't want, so we use a [slice](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_string_slice.asp) to remove the first two characters.

```python
        opc_hex = hex(opc)[2:]
```

We need `opc_hex` to be two characters.
If the length is only one, prepend a zero.

```python
        if len(opc_hex) == 1:
          opc_hex = "0" + opc_hex
```

This is a [`Template` string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings).
This means we'll be able to substitute template variables (`${<var name>}`) with values to produce the actual code.

```python
        yul_code = Template("""
        {
```

We start with a call `0x00...0060A7` (a.k.a. `goat_addr`) so we'll have some return data.
Otherwise, [`RETURNDATACOPY`](https://www.evm.codes/#3e?fork=merge) will fail and appear like it is not an opcode.

```python
           pop(call(gas(), 0x60A7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0))

           // fails on opcodes with >20 inputs
           // (currently dup16, at 17 inputs, is the
           // one that goes deepest)
           //
           // Follow with 32 NOPs (0x5B) to handle PUSH, which has an immediate
           // operand
```

Opcodes can have two types of operands:

- Immediate operands, which are part of the bytecode.
  For example, `6001` is [`PUSH1`](https://www.evm.codes/#60?fork=merge) with the value `0x01`.
- Implied operands (a.k.a. stack operands), which come from the stack.

This [`verbatim`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/yul.html#verbatim) code provides both operand types.
The code, `${opcode}${nop32}` is the opcode we are testing, followed by 32 copies of 0x5B.
When `0x5B` is not used as an operand, it is [`JUMPDEST`](https://www.evm.codes/#5b?fork=merge) and does nothing.

```python
           verbatim_20i_0o(hex"${opcode}${nop32}",
```

The opcode string is followed by the input parameters (in this case, twenty of them).
These can be Yul expressions, but for the sake of simplicity here we just use constant values.

```python
              0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF,
              0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF,
              0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF,
              0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF)
```

If the opcode terminates the smart contract execution (as invalid opcodes do), we don't get here.
If we do get here, write to storage cell `0x00` to record that fact.

Note the syntax `let <var> := <value>`. This is how you specify variables in Yul.

```python
           // We only get here is the opcode is legit (and it doesn't terminate
           // execution like STOP and RETURN)
           let zero := 0
           let one := 1
           sstore(zero, one)
        }
```

Replace `${opcode}` with the one byte hex code, and `${nop32}` with 32 copies of `5b` (for NOP).

```python
        """).substitute(opcode=opc_hex, nop32="5B"*32)
        pre = {
           TestAddress: Account(balance=0x0BA1A9CE0BA1A9CE),
           codeAddr: Account(
  balance=0,
  nonce=1,
  code=Yul(yul_code)
           ),
```

This is the account for `0x00..0060A7`.
It just returns data (all zeros).

```python
           goat_addr: Account(
                balance=0,
                nonce=1,
                code=Yul("{ return(0, 0x100) }"),
           )
        }
```

Every time the `for` loop gets here, it [`yields`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yieldexpr) a separate test.
Over the entire for loop, it yields 255 different tests.

```python
    yield StateTest(
        env=env, 
        pre=pre, 
        tx=tx,
        post=(post_valid if opc_valid(opc) else post_invalid),
    )
```

The Python format for the [ternary operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_conditional_operator) is a bit different from C-like languages.
In C like languages the syntax is `<condition> ? <yes value> : <no value>`.
In Python it is `<yes value> if <condition> else <no value>`.
