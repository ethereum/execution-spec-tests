# Benchmark Test Cases

Benchmark tests aim to maximize the usage of a specific opcode, precompile, or operation within a transaction or block. They are located in the `./tests/benchmarks` folder and the available test cases are documented in [test case reference](../tests/benchmark/index.md).

To fill a benchmark test, in addition to the usual test flags, you must include the `-m benchmark` flag. This is necessary because benchmark tests are ignored by default; they must be manually selected via the `benchmark` pytest marker (="tag"). This marker is applied to all tests under `./tests/benchmark/` automatically by the framework.

**Note:** Benchmark tests are now only available starting from the `Prague` fork. Tests targeting earlier forks (`Cancun` or prior) are not supported in benchmark mode.

## Setting the Gas Limit for Benchmarking

To consume the full benchmark gas limit, use the `gas_benchmark_value` fixture as the gas limit:

```py
def test_benchmark(
    blockchain_test: BlockchainTestFiller,
    pre: Alloc,
    gas_benchmark_value: int
):
    ...
```

You can specify the block gas limit used in benchmark tests by setting the `--gas-benchmark-values` flag. This flag accepts a comma-separated list of values (in millions of gas), e.g. `--gas-benchmark-values 1,10,45,60`. This example would run the test 4 times, using a `gas_benchmark_value` of 1M, 10M, 45M, and 60M respectively.

Do not configure the transaction/block gas limit to `env.gas_limit`. When running in benchmark mode, the test framework sets this value to a very large number (e.g., `1_000_000_000_000`), this setup allows the framework to reuse a single genesis file for all specified gas limits. I.e., the example below is invalid:

```py
def test_benchmark(
    blockchain_test: BlockchainTestFiller,
    pre: Alloc,
    env: Environment
):
    ...
    tx = Transaction(
        to=opcode_address,
        gas_limit=env.gas_limit, # Do not set the gas_limit manually.
        sender=pre.fund_eoa(),
    )
    ...
```

## Expected Gas Usage

In benchmark mode, the developer should set the expected gas consumption using the `expected_benchmark_gas_used` field. Benchmark tests do not need to consume the full gas limit, instead, you could calculate and specify the expected usage. If `expected_benchmark_gas_used` is not set, the test will fall back to using `gas_benchmark_value` as the expected value.

```py
@pytest.mark.valid_from("Prague")
def test_empty_block(
    blockchain_test: BlockchainTestFiller,
    pre: Alloc,
):
    """Test running an empty block as a baseline for fixed proving costs."""
    blockchain_test(
        pre=pre,
        post={},
        blocks=[Block(txs=[])],
        expected_benchmark_gas_used=0,
    )
```

This is a safety check to make sure the benchmark works as expected. For example, if a test uses the `JUMP` instruction but the jump destination is invalid, each transaction will stop early. That means it won't use as much gas as we expected.

This check helps catch such issues. As a result, the post-storage comparison method via `SSTORE` is no longer needed, thereby reducing the additional storage cost.
