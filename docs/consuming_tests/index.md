# Consuming Tests Overview

This section covers how clients can consume the test fixtures (^=test vectors) generated by @ethereum/execution-spec-tests to verify their implementations.

There are two main approaches:

1. **Direct fixture consumption**: Clients consume JSON fixtures directly via custom commands implemented in their own codebase, e.g., geth's [`evm statetest`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/4bb097b7ffc32256791e55ff16ca50ef83c4609b/cmd/evm/staterunner.go) and [`evm blocktest`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/4bb097b7ffc32256791e55ff16ca50ef83c4609b/cmd/evm/blockrunner.go) commands. This performs a module test of EL client functionality.

2. **Test execution via Hive Simulators**: The test cases from the test fixtures are executed against a fully-instantiated client as a system test using the @ethereum/hive Test Framework via the EEST `consume rlp` and `consume engine` simulators.

    - For help running the tests against a client via @ethereum/hive, see **[Consume Command](./consume/index.md)**
