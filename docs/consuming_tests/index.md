# Consuming Tests Overview

This section covers how to consume test fixtures generated by execution-spec-tests to validate execution client implementations.

## Two Main Approaches

**Direct fixture consumption**: Clients consume JSON fixtures directly via built-in commands like `blocktest`, `statetest`, etc.

**EEST consume framework**: A comprehensive testing framework that supports multiple consumption methods including RLP block import, Engine API testing, and Hive simulator integration.

## Getting Started

- **For client developers**: Start with the [Consume Command guide](./consume/index.md) which covers all consumption methods with practical examples
- **For test fixture specifications**: See [Test Fixture Specifications](./test_formats/index.md) for detailed format documentation
