# State Tests <!-- markdownlint-disable MD051 (MD051=link-fragments "Link fragments should be valid") -->

The State Test fixture format tests are included in the fixtures subdirectory `state_tests`.

These are produced by the `StateTest` and `StateTestOnly` test specs.

## Description

The state test fixture format is used to test the state transition function of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

It does so by defining a transaction, a pre-execution state, and a post-execution state, and verifying that the transaction execution results in the expected post-execution state.

A single JSON fixture file is composed of a JSON object where each key-value pair is a different [`Fixture`](#fixture) test object, with the key string representing the test name.

The JSON file path plus the test name are used as the unique test identifier.

As opposed to other fixture formats, the state test fixture format could contain multiple test vectors per test object, each represented by an element in the mapping of lists of the `post` field.

However tests generated by the `execution-spec-tests` repository do **not** use this feature, as every single test object contains only a single test vector.

## Consumption

For each [`Fixture`](#-fixture) test object in the JSON fixture file, perform the following steps:

1. Use [`pre`](#-pre-alloc) as the starting state allocation of the execution environment for the test.
2. Use [`env`](#-env-fixtureenvironment) to configure the current execution environment.
3. For each [`Fork`](./common_types.md#fork) key of [`post`](#-post-mappingforklist-fixtureforkpost) in the test, and for each of the elements of the list of [`FixtureForkPost`](#fixtureforkpost) values:

    1. Configure the execution fork schedule according to the current [`Fork`](./common_types.md#fork) key.
    2. Using the [`indexes`](#-indexes-fixtureforkpostindexes) values, and the [`transaction`](#-transaction-fixturetransaction) object, decode the transaction to be executed.
    3. If the serialized version of the decoded transaction does not match [`txbytes`](#-txbytes-bytes), fail the test.
    4. Attempt to apply the transaction using the current execution environment:

        1. If the transaction could not be applied to the current execution context:
            - If [`expectException`](#-expectexception-str) is empty, fail the test.
            - If [`expectException`](#-expectexception-str) is not empty, revert the state to the pre-state.
        2. If the transaction could be applied to the current execution context:
            - If [`expectException`](#-expectexception-str) is not empty, fail the test.

    5. Compare the resulting post-state root with the expected post-state root contained in the [`hash`](#-hash-hash) field of the current [`FixtureForkPost`](#fixtureforkpost), and fail the test if they do not match.
    6. Compare the resulting logs hash with the expected logs contained in the [`logs`](#-logs-hash) field of the current [`FixtureForkPost`](#fixtureforkpost), and fail the test if they do not match.
